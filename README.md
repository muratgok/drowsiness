# Driver Drowsiness Detection Dataset

This repository provides the datasets used in the study *“Real-Time Driver Drowsiness Detection Using Facial Landmarks and Embedded AI”*.

The data were collected from 115 volunteer participants during controlled and real driving experiments under nighttime conditions. The datasets include synchronized visual, behavioral, and physiological indicators related to driver fatigue.

## Dataset Contents
- Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and blink rate measurements  
- Head pose parameters (yaw, pitch, roll) extracted from facial landmarks  
- PERCLOS and steering error values representing behavioral impairment  
- Anonymized participant demographic information  

All datasets are fully anonymized and contain no personally identifiable information. The data are provided for research and educational purposes only.

## Usage
The datasets are intended for academic research on driver monitoring, fatigue analysis, and embedded computer vision systems.
